For this to work correctly, the proper format is '#MENUCOLOR:r,g,b,a;', where r,g,b,a are values from 0.0 to 1.0. R is red, g is green, b is blue, and a is ambience. Also, specifying a valid name will work. The names are: white, black, brightred, brightgreen,brightblue, red, green, blue, yellow, pink, purple, orange, cyan, seagreen, ddrgreen, ddryellow, ddrblue, ddrpurple. Also, you can set extra (Extra Stage color) and group (set a file that defaults to Extra Stage color back to the group color).
